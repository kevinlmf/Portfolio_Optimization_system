# Portfolio Optimization System

Market-adaptive portfolio optimization system integrating 133-factor analysis, market regime detection, intelligent method selection, and multi-asset allocation.

## Key Features

## Key Features
- 5 market regimes with adaptive strategy selection (including mixture-based regime modeling)  
- 6 optimization methods including Bayesian and globally optimal sparse Sharpe portfolio  
- 133-factor library with 6 selection methods (IC, LASSO, Random Forest, etc.)  
- 16-year backtest (2008â€“2024): 12.8% annual return, 0.677 Sharpe ratio, 6.6% alpha

## Core Components

### 1. Bayesian + Mixture Model System

Probabilistic regime detection with soft transitions:
- Mixture Model: Soft regime probabilities instead of hard classification
- Bayesian Optimization: Regime-aware portfolio with uncertainty quantification
- Online Learning: Adaptive posterior updates with anomaly detection


### 2. Factor Analysis

- 133-factor library: technical, fundamental, macro, ML, beta
- 6 selection methods: IC Analysis, LASSO, Random Forest, MI, Forward Selection, Factor Returns
- Style factors: Fama-French 3/5-factor, Carhart 4-factor models
- Factor timing: Momentum-based rotation and tilting

### 3. Market Regime Detection

Adaptive strategy selection across 5 regimes:

| Regime | Strategy | Holdings |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Bull Market | Max Sharpe | 10-15 |
| Bear Market | Min Variance | 15-20 |
| Sideways | Risk Parity | All |
| High Volatility | Min Variance | 15-20 |
| Crisis | Equal Weight | All |

### 4. Optimization Methods

- Max Sharpe
- Min Variance
- Risk Parity
- Equal Weight
- Sparse Sharpe (NeurIPS 2024)
- Factor-Tilted
- Bayesian Mean-Variance

### 5. Asset Universe

Equities: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, JPM, JNJ | ETFs: SPY, QQQ, VTI, VEA, VWO | Bonds: TLT, IEF, LQD, HYG | Commodities: GLD, SLV, DBC | Crypto: BTC-USD, ETH-USD
